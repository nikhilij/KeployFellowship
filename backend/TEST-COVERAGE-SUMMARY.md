## 📄 Testing Tools and Scripts

### Available NPM Scripts

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run only unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Run only integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run only API tests
npm run test:api

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

### Running Individual Test Files

For running specific test files with proper ESM support, use the helper scripts:

#### Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
./run-test.ps1 <test-file-path>
```

#### Unix/Linux/Mac:

```bash
./run-test.sh <test-file-path>
```

> **Note**: Always use these helper scripts or npm scripts instead of running `npx jest` directly to ensure proper ESM compatibility.
