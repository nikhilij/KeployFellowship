This is a Next.js (JavaScript) project using shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS. The app provides a CRUD interface for a Book resource (title, author, publishedYear) using the backend API endpoints:
- POST /api/books
- GET /api/books
- PUT /api/books/:id
- DELETE /api/books/:id

Generate modern, accessible, and clean UI using shadcn/ui components. All API calls should use fetch and handle errors gracefully.
